## Perceptual Capacities and Constraints in AR/VR for the visualization of 3D biomedical image data.

Organizers: PhD, Georges Hattab and Prof. Roy Eagleson.

The use of AR and VR modalities for visualization of 3D biomedical image data is feasible thanks to a growing number of hardware and software solutions. As the technical challenges and development hurdles subside, it is increasingly important to consider the special capacities and constraints of the human perceptual, motor, and cognitive systems. From a systems design perspective, empirical research into the human-computer interface performance should inform the development process. We present essential design notions including, but not limited to, task oriented design, lateral and vertical transformations, and user interface design principles. Generally, this can take the form of 'development guidelines' or alternatively, as anti-patterns which alert the designer to the principles that should not be violated. 

For the purpose of this tutorial, we plan a practical or hands-on session. Given different visualization tasks, participants work in small groups to create appropriate visualizations. We anticipate that this could lead to an exploration of the design space. In turn, we could indicate what might benefit from adjustment or be better suited to the task at hand.

This tutorial is a forum for Scientific and Engineering developments in this area, as well as for two talks which overview these different aspects of the field from Prof. Bernhard Preim and Prof. Nassir Navab.
